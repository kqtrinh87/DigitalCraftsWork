            My Pick for Coolest Place to Visit!
    </h1>
        <p>Hi there! I'm <b>Khanh</b> and my pick for the coolest place to visit is the <b>Big Bend National Park</b>, which is located <a href="https://www.nps.gov/bibe/index.htm"><i>southwest of Texas</i></a>.
            The park borders with Rio Grande River and it's known to have the lowest amount of light population in Texas.
